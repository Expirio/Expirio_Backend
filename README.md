## Backend

- [ ] Persist amount of attempts trying to reveal the secret (also add a mapper, I forget easily how data is mapped)
- [ ] Add expiration time (chronos?, carbon?, they help to test things better), don't forget the mapper
- [ ] Add CLI commands (ehy execute the app easier, not needing set routes and controllers, servers... )
- [ ] Add routes framework
- [ ] Add read and write templates


## System:

- [ ] Think about nginx
- [ ] How to provision a centos (needed vagrant to try)


## Deployiment

- [ ] Think about deploying
