## TODO:

- [ ] We need to encrypt and decrypt a text using a password (same for both). 
- [ ] We need to hash a password and check that the same password match with the hash created. 
- [ ] We need to use GUIDS to generate random strings (this will be used for the URLS, but for now this functionality is fine)
- [ ] < More coming >, I will update this tomorrow with more indications. 


### Notes:
> - **PLEASE, USE PHP-7**, is a new web app and we don't want to update it in the early future.
>
> - We care about the code. All of us are also developers, the product must work, but we also think about the code because the project will grow up and we will ad more ideas (layers, structure, coding style, etc).
>
> - We want to see tests for this. Is the way we can see that things are working at this level.
>
> - As a suggestion I would say that phpunit would be a great decision, and also this third party library to create GUIDS is also 
very good: https://github.com/ramsey/uuid
>
> - RELAX, AND ENJOY!, we also understand how hard is coding......too much!
